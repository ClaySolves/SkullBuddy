## Disclaimer

SkullBuddy does not allow the user to hack, cheat, abuse, manipulate, 
change or otherwise obtain unauthorised access to any benefits or 
features in-game and does not automate gameplay mechanisms, only 
menu navigation. Skullbuddy uses the PyAutoGUI library for game navigation and a
combination of in-game screenshots and tesseract OCR to retrieve game data. 
Skullbuddy does not read game memory or access data not availble to the player by 
default. SkullBuddy only interacts with navigation outside of the dungeon.
